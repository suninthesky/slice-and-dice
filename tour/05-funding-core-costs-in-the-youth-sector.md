### Composite theme

How might we categorise work that uses the arts to ease mental health conditions in ex-servicemen and women?

You could legitimately say it relates to an "arts" funding theme, as much as it does to "mental health". This is where composite funding themes like "arts + mental health" or "tech + abuse" help us describe specialist or overlapping areas of funding.

For this last **slice** of [core costs + youth]({{ page.query }}){:target="_blank"} we can see that as expected [Esmée Fairbairn Foundation](https://www.esmeefairbairn.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} who give the most "core cost" funding, have been steadily providing infrastructure support to the "youth" sector since 2009.
